# Real-Time-Vision-Based-Fall-Detection-Using-YOLOv8-Pose
Falls pose a significant risk to elderly individuals and workers at heights, often leading to severe injuries. This paper presents a real-time vision-based fall detection system that leverages YOLOv8 for person detection and YOLOv8-Pose for keypoint estimation. The proposed approach computes an adaptive body vector from selected landmarks (mid-shoulder, mid-hip, mid-knee, mid-ankle) and projects it onto a dynamic horizontal line at the person's base. Fall initiation is detected when the normalized projection exceeds 0.35, with completion at 0.93. A state-based timer tracks fall duration and distinguishes "falling" from "fell" states, reducing false positives from activities like bending.
Evaluated on demonstration videos with diverse postures, the system achieves robust real-time performance, high sensitivity, and low false alarms. By utilizing existing CCTV infrastructure, it offers a cost-effective, non-intrusive solution suitable for elderly monitoring and occupational safety.
